# Patterns in Dengue Cases

This project leverages the H2O library in Python to explore patterns within the dengue case database from the São Carlos Health Department in Brazil for the year 2021. Given the dataset’s sensitivity, protected under Brazil’s LGPD (General Data Protection Law), it cannot be shared in full. However, the code structure follows the model described in the accompanying data dictionary file, enabling users to adapt it to different datasets and interpret diverse data scenarios.

Developed as part of my research at the University of São Paulo (USP), this project aims to provide a framework for building and analyzing models, offering insights into disease patterns while respecting data privacy constraints.
