# Patterns in Dengue Cases

This project utilizes the H2O library in Python to identify patterns in the dengue case database from the São Carlos Health Department in Brazil for the year 2021. Due to the sensitive nature of the dataset, which is protected under the LGPD (General Data Protection Law), it is not possible to provide a fully usable dataset. However, by following the model outlined in the data dictionary file, this code can be used to generate new models for any dataset and can also be applied to interpret other data.

Developed by me as part of research at the University of São Paulo (USP).
